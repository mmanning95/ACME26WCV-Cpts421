## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, we laid the groundwork for our e-Post Hub. Our efforts focused on integrating SQL databases, designing the Next.js application structure, and configuring GitHub Actions. While we encountered challenges with the initial Next.js setup, we were able to resolve them by leveraging resources from YouTube, which have been documented in the Training folder for future reference.
