2. Meeting Summary

Introduction:

Acme26WCV is composed of two computer science students, Melvin Manning and Anthony Graves, working on the capstone project for CPTS 421.  
The project is to assist the client, Becky Buri, with a way to better engage with veterans and keep them informed about upcoming events 
and opportunities.  The team intends to assist the client by streamlining the process currently used by our VSO, as well as provide her with new
and better options to accomplish her tasks.

Clientâ€™s Requirements:

The client expressed concern about the accessibility of information given the tendency for the veterans
who she is responsible for tend to be from an older demographic.  The client also expressed a desire to compile 
the information into a more user-friendly and readable format.

Currently, she uses an ePost (monthly email sent out to a list of veterans) on an Excel spreadsheet.  Sheet has nonfunctioning
hyperlinks and is generally hard to navigate.

The client would like to keep things as simple as possible to use on her part. The client would also like to utilize
existing tools she is already familiar with, or tools that do not require too steep of a learning curve.
The client would prefer it if filters were set in place to minimize moderation of events and user comments on her part.



Discussion on specific features and functionalities expected by the client:

The client would like interested parties to be able to submit events.
The client would like users to be able to leave feedback on event postings.
The client expects to be able to share events on social media.
The client wants to be able to use the same database that stores information for the website event postings to automatically 
populate her monthly email newsletter with the same events.
The client would like to compile a comprehensive  list of individuals and organizations involved in veteran's
services.
The Client wants easier communication between any parties of interest that deal with veteran's services.
The Client wants users to be able to filter events to only show events that they are likely to be interested in.



Key Discussion Points:

1.) What are the goals of our client?

2.) What type of platform would be best to achieve these goals?

3.) What features should this platform have to achieve these goals?



Decisions Made:

1.) A Website would be the best platform to achieve the client's goals and requirements.

2.) The website should enhance and complement existing tools our VSO currently employs, such as her ePost.
