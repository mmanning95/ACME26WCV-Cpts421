MEETING SUMMARY:



INTRODUCTION:


Acme26WCV is composed of two computer science students, Melvin Manning and Anthony Graves, working on the capstone project for CPTS 421. The project is to assist the client, Becky Buri, with a way to better engage with veterans and keep them informed about upcoming events and opportunities. The team intends to assist the client by streamlining the process currently used by our VSO, as well as provide her with new and better options to accomplish her tasks.
