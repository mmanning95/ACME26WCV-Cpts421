2. MEETING SUMMARY:

Introduction:

Acme26WCV is composed of two computer science students, Melvin Manning and Anthony Graves, working on the capstone project for CPTS 421.
The project is to assist the client, Becky Buri, with a way to better engage with veterans and keep them informed about upcoming events and opportunities. The team intends to assist the client by streamlining the process currently used by our VSO, as well as provide her with new and better options to accomplish her tasks.

CLIENT'S REQUIREMENTS:

Some of the new ideas the client expressed a need for were the following:

1.) Users who submit events should have most of the fields used to create the form be optional, with some being required (Event title, event date etc.)

2.) A way for users interested in an event to connect with the event organizer's website.

3.) A feature that would be like a miniature e-Post (her monthly newsletter), but it would be sent out at shorter intervals and would only include events a user has expressed interest in.

4.) A way for users to filter events based on the proximity of an event to them, or events that are local to them.

5.) The need for the events filter to provide links to websites that may be loosely related to the event (eg: An event that is a workshop for people with dementia, could also provide helpful links to resources for mental health).

6.) A calendar on the Veteran e-Post Hub that pulls events from calendars on other websites that do veteran-related work.

7.) A way for users to suggest improvements to a veteran services officer's provided services.

8.) A way to request or share resources that could be beneficial to veterans, such as the need for a wheelchair.


KEY DISCUSSION POINTS:

The following were the major points discussed with the client:

Discussion point 1: Feedback from the client on how Veteran's e-Post is progressing.

Discussion point 2: New features that the client may require for the website and her e-Post.

Discussion point 3: A schedule for regular correspondence with the client. 


DECISIONS MADE:

The following decisions made are meant to connect directly with the client's requirements listed above.

1.) The form used for event creation will have most fields be optional, with minimal required fields.

2.) An optional field of input on the event creation form will be the event organizer's website, or a website dedicated to the event so the user can obtain more detailed information that may not be provided on Veteran e-Post Hub.

3.) The "Interested" button that is already being implemented will allow the user to opt in to regular email updates or reminders about an event.

4.) The events filter can provide a dropdown menu or some other way to filter events based on proximity (eg: Option 1: 10 miles away, Option 2: 20 miles away etc.)

5.) The events filter can also have links that are loosely related to the event (eg: A category for events could be "Mental Health" and this would also provide links to websites that may be beneficial to the user.)

6.) [No concrete decisions at this time about how this feature may be implemented, more research required]

7.) A "suggestion box" could be implemented for users to submit feedback on Veterans Services or on Veteran e-Post Hub.  This could possibly be integrated with the question button that is already a feature being implemented.

8.) The "suggestion box" or question button could perhaps provide a way for users to request or donate resources that may be beneficial to veterans.  This could be sent to the client directly or posted publicly.

The following decisions made are not tied directly to client requirements but were made to satisfy meeting agenda requirements.

1.) At least one in person meeting with the client will be done at each sprint to obtain client feedback.

2.) Every time a major milestone of the project is achieved, the client will be updated through email.

3.) Weekly correspondence through email to touch base.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4. NEXT STEPS:

The next steps discussed with the client were: 

1.) Provide regular updates via email correspondence to ensure client satisfaction with how the project is progressing.

2.) Successfully implement user authentication, as this is a required functionality to access many of the website's features.
