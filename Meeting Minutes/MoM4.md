INTRODUCTION:


Acme26WCV is composed of two computer science students, Melvin Manning and Anthony Graves, working on the capstone project for CPTS 421. The project is to assist the client, Becky Buri, with a way to better engage with veterans and keep them informed about upcoming events and opportunities.
