MEETING SUMMARY:


INTRODUCTION:


Acme26WCV is composed of two computer science students, Melvin Manning and Anthony Graves, working on the capstone project for CPTS 421. The project is to assist the client, Becky Buri, with a way to better engage with veterans and keep them informed about upcoming events and opportunities. The team intends to assist the client by streamlining the process currently used by our VSO, as well as provide her with new and better options to accomplish her tasks.


CLIENT'S REQUIREMENTS:


1.) Relax permissions, guests can now create events. (possible need to create a new way for event submission).

2.) Basic pattern or graphics choice behind event fliers and homepage.

3.) For the existing e-Post system, file size limit restrictions make it so fliers cannot be viewed in emails.

4.) Veteran's resources page, need a way to filter sensitive information.

5.) Calendar on the homepage.

6.) Some way to segment events by different dates?  maybe a line separating certain months.

7.) VA news and ongoing stuff possibly added towards the bottom of the page. A link possibly for relevant VA information.

 - VA news has its own section, a scrollbar on the side is a possible solution to navigating events.

- Possible button at the top that leads to a subpage for VA events.

8.) Clickable tiles in the email e-Post that take you directly to the event in question on the website.

9.) Recommend a friend button in the e-Post for people to opt in to email notifications.

 - Notify me button for new posts. Bimonthly emails about updates or new events. 

10.) Slides to navigate the website? Need some way for new users to be able to learn how to navigate the website to access the sections that are relevant to them.

11.) Scrollable fliers or pictures for ongoing events on the homepage? 

12.) The client has received permission to use the WDVA logo but needs to find some way to integrate it into the website.


KEY DISCUSSION POINTS:


1.) Is the client happy with the Figma prototype?

2.) Necessary features for the  website.

2.) Timeline for project completion.


DECISIONS MADE:


The following points are meant to map to their respective sections in Client Requirements.

1.) All users will now be able to create events.  A warning will be displayed when a guest creates an event stating that creating an event without an account will result in the user unable to make changes without contacting an admin for the e-Post Hub.

2.) A basic pattern or choice of graphics will be placed in the  background of the homepage.

3.) No decisions made at this time.

4.) Manual screening will be performed before adding a Veteran resource to the resource page.

5.) A calendar will be added to the homepage.

6.) We can segment events in separate months with a different background color for each month.

7.) Two designs will be tried and submitted for client approval.  

- One design will feature a button at the top of the homepage leading to a subpage containing relevant VA information.

- One design will feature VA information contained within its own section on the homepage

8.) Clickable tiles will be implemented for the monthly newsletter that will link the user to the event they are interested in on the website.

9.) A button will be implemented allowing users to share the website with other interested parties.

10.) No decisions made at this time.

11.) Users can scroll through events on the homepage.

12.) The homepage will now have a "contacts" bar with the WDVA logo at the bottom.
