# Veteran e-Post Hub

## Project summary

Introducing the Veteran E-Post Hub, a dynamic full-stack application designed to empower our community! Admin users can seamlessly moderate events—approving, rejecting, or deleting submissions—while also creating their own. Member users can submit events for approval, manage their own posts, and engage with comments. Plus, everyone—logged in or not—can explore a curated list of events, filter to find what matters most, and easily reach out to admins with any questions. Join us in fostering a vibrant community where every voice is heard!

### Additional information about the project

Veteran e-Post Hub is designed to be a full-stack app platform for keeping the Veterans of Whitman County informed about local events and opportunities. The website will be administered by Becky Buri, the Whitman County Veterans' Services Officer, enabling her to serve the veteran community more effectively. The platform will feature user event submissions, personalized event filtering based on user interests, and social media integration, all within a user-friendly and accessible interface. The e-Post team is enthusiastic about this project and considers it an honor to assist in serving the local veteran community.

### Functionality

At this stage of the project, we have completed key development tasks, including laying the foundation for the website, creating a homepage, an admin page, an event editing page for administrators.

When on the  homepage, to access the admin page, click the button located in the top-left corner of the screen which will direct you to the dedicated admin interface. On this page you will find two buttons: one to return to the homepage and another to access the event editing page. By selecting the "Edit Events" button you will be taken to the admin event editing page where you can modify fields such as Event Title, Event Description, and more. The page also includes two buttons in the top-left corner, one to return to the homepage and the other to navigate back to the admin interface.
